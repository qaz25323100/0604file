Now I'll look at the implementation of the handleOnDragStart function to understand how it works with different node types.

App.vue:handleOnDragStart
Thought Process




Based on the code I found, I can explain how the handleOnDragStart function works when dragging different node types in your Vue Flow application.

How handleOnDragStart Works
The function is defined as:

"""

function handleOnDragStart(event: DragEvent, nodeType: any) {
 if (event.dataTransfer) {
   event.dataTransfer.setData('application/vueflow', nodeType)
   event.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = 'move'
 }
}

"""
Key Functionality
It accepts two parameters:
event: The browser's DragEvent object
nodeType: A string identifying the type of node being dragged
When a node is dragged, the function:
Stores the node type in the drag event's dataTransfer object using the MIME type 'application/vueflow'
Sets the drag effect to 'move', indicating this is a move operation
Node Types Being Used
I found the function being called with different node types throughout your App.vue:

LLM nodes
code nodes
knowledge nodes
api nodes
workflow nodes
Each of these node types is passed to the handler when the respective element is dragged, allowing the application to identify what kind of node is being dragged when it's later dropped into the flow.

This simple but effective mechanism allows your application to handle different node types in a consistent way during drag operations, with the node type being the key piece of information transferred.
